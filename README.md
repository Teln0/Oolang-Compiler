# Oolang Compiler

Compiler for the oolang programming language.

### Goals of Oolang :
- to be portable : Oolang runs on a VM and bytecode files can be shared between all systems an Oolang VM is available on
- to be secure : Oolang is intented to be a language for running mods, plugins, and untrusted code. VM's memory usage and speed can be limited.
- to be versatile : Oolang's standard library can easily be modified or replaced, to allow Oolang programs to interact with your own program as a mod or plugin.
The VM is available as a library.

### Where it's currently at :
Oolang is currently being completely reworked for the 5th (and probably final) time. I am currently working on code generation.
